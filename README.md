# README
Welcome to Outer Circle!

Use this readme to get started setting up and exploring Outer Cricle!

## Required tools

If you don't already have these tools, download and install them before you start working with the Apparel Store app.

* Modern web browser (may we suggest [Chrome?](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser))
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
	* Mac OSX: Terminal is already installed, or try [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)
	* Windows: Command Prompt (DOS)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) 
* A text editor or coding tool of your choice. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is available for free for Mac and Windows, but will occassionally ask you to purchase a license when you save your files. 

## Setup

Once you have all prerequisites installed, open your CLI and navigate to the project folder.

_New to command line?_ Navigate to the project folder using `cd` (which stands for change directory). If you know the full path of the directory you can type it in, or you can click and drag the folder over to your CLI window and it will automatically fill in the path to that folder.

		cd /Users/mycomp/Documents/we-code-node-starter

Press return, and you'll be taken to that folder.

To install the app, type `npm install` and press return. You should see several packages and dependencies being installed.
