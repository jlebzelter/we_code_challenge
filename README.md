# README
Welcome to Outer Circle!
Use this readme to get started setting up and exploring Outer Cricle!

## Inspiration
Has it been difficult for you to make friends? Imagine you as a recent college grad moved to Portland to land a job and you are looking for local things to do in town but you find it difficult to find a friend to hang out with. Despite the abundance of social media networks, you are not connected with anyone in Portland. You are open to meet with people who are different from you but you donâ€™t know how to go about finding them. Outer Circle is here to help to "expand their horizons. It helps you to find others who, despite differences, share the same interests as you and connects you to their profiles.

## How it works

1) The user logs into the website using their LinkedIn credentials and their profile is pulled into "OuterCircle." 2) They then are asked brief questions to find their interests
3) The app then finds dissimilar people with common interests to the user that they can connect with. 4) These profiles are presented and the user selects who they want to connect with. 5) If a match is made a chat is created between the users allowing them to learn more about each other and plan a meetup, if desired.

## Target audience

Social media users looking to connect with new people to expand their horizons.

## Required tools

If you don't already have these tools, download and install them before you start working with the Apparel Store app.

* Modern web browser (may we suggest [Chrome?](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser))
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
	* Mac OSX: Terminal is already installed, or try [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)
	* Windows: Command Prompt (DOS)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) 
* A text editor or coding tool of your choice. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is available for free for Mac and Windows, but will occassionally ask you to purchase a license when you save your files. 

## Setup

Once you have all prerequisites installed, open your CLI and navigate to the project folder.

_New to command line?_ Navigate to the project folder using `cd` (which stands for change directory). If you know the full path of the directory you can type it in, or you can click and drag the folder over to your CLI window and it will automatically fill in the path to that folder.

		cd /Users/mycomp/Documents/we-code-node-starter

Press return, and you'll be taken to that folder.

To install the app, type `npm install` and press return. You should see several packages and dependencies being installed.

To start the app, type `node app.js` in the command line. After a few seconds, you should see a success message. Keep your command line tool open, and open a new tab in your web browser. In the URL bar, type `http://localhost:8889/static/index.html`.

To stop serving the page to your browser, press Control+C in the CLI.
